## Session History


### Session 2026-02-15T16:45:40.777Z

**Symptoms Reported:**
Headache, fever, and fatigue for the past 3 days

**Additional Health Context:**
No known allergies, generally healthy


**Diagnosis & Recommendations:**
Based on your current symptoms of headache, fever, and fatigue lasting 3 days, and your reported history of generally good health with no known allergies, here are some recommendations:

Possible causes could include:
- Viral infection (like flu or common cold)
- Mild dehydration
- Sleep deprivation
- Stress-related tension headache

Treatment recommendations:
1. Rest and get adequate sleep
2. Stay well hydrated with water and clear fluids
3. Take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for headache and fever (following package directions)
4. Monitor your temperature
5. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond 5-7 days, contact your healthcare provider

Warning signs to watch for:
- Severe headache
- High fever (above 103°F/39.4°C)
- Difficulty breathing
- Confusion or altered mental state
- Severe dehydration

Since you have no known chronic conditions and are generally healthy, these symptoms are likely due to a common viral illness that should resolve with supportive care. However, if you have any concerns or your condition worsens, please consult with your healthcare provider.
