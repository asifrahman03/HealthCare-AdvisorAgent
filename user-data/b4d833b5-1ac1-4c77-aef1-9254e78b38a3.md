**Symptoms Reported:**
Headache, fever, and fatigue for the past 3 days

**Additional Health Context:**
No known allergies, generally healthy


**Diagnosis & Recommendations:**
Based on your reported symptoms of headache, fever, and fatigue for the past 3 days, along with your context of being generally healthy with no known allergies, these symptoms could indicate a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold. Here are some recommendations:

1. Rest and hydration: Ensure you get plenty of rest and drink fluids to stay hydrated.

2. Over-the-counter medications: Consider taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help reduce fever and alleviate headache pain. Always follow the recommended dosage instructions.

3. Monitor symptoms: Keep track of your symptoms. If they worsen or persist beyond a week, or if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, or confusion, seek medical attention.

4. Isolation: If you suspect you might have the flu, try to avoid close contact with others to prevent spreading the illness.

5. Consult a healthcare provider: If you have any concerns or if symptoms are severe, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Remember, these recommendations are based on your reported symptoms and context. If you have any pre-existing conditions or concerns, please consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
