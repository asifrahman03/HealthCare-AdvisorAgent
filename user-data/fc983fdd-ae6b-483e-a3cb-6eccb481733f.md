**Symptoms Reported:**
Headache, fever, and fatigue for the past 3 days

**Additional Health Context:**
No known allergies, generally healthy


**Diagnosis & Recommendations:**
Based on your current symptoms of headache, fever, and fatigue that have been present for the past 3 days, these could be signs of a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold. Since you mentioned that you are generally healthy and have no known allergies, it is likely that your body is fighting off an infection.

To help alleviate your symptoms and support your recovery, I recommend the following:

1. Rest: Make sure to get plenty of rest to allow your body to heal.
2. Hydration: Drink lots of fluids, such as water, herbal teas, and clear broths, to stay hydrated.
3. Over-the-counter medications: You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help reduce fever and relieve headache and body aches. Be sure to follow the recommended dosage instructions.
4. Monitor your symptoms: Keep an eye on your temperature and overall condition. If your symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week, or if you develop additional symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe headache, seek medical attention promptly.

Remember to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, to prevent the spread of infection to others. If you have any concerns or questions about your symptoms, don't hesitate to consult with a healthcare professional for further guidance.
